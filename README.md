# UFO_Sightings

#### Purpose
-The purpose of this webpage deployment is to provide a central, filterable location for UFO sightings. The data can be filtered based on location (city, state, and country) as well as shape fo the UFO and date of the sighting.

#### Use of Webpage
-To filter the table embeded in the webpage, simply type the filter criteria into each filter input field, or leave a field blank to not filter based on that criterion
-To remove a filter, simply delete the contents of that fitler field, or refresh the page to clear all filters.

#### Drawbacks of presented form
-The criterion must be manually entered, and must be and exact match to whats presented in the data, including case.
-There is no way to update the data list from the webpage.

#### Future Development
-Change the manual entry boxes to dropdown lists populated by available data. This will prevent some user input errors. This would also allow the inputs to be formatted for visual effect (capitalization, coloration, bolding, etc.)
-Create a secondary submit form on the page that will allow new sightings to be entered into the data. Potentially seperate new entries from existing data with a "confirmed" boolean filter, and allow the site admin to update new sightings on confirmation.
